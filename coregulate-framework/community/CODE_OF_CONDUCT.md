# Coregulate Framework Community Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

The Coregulate Framework community is dedicated to creating a harassment-free, inclusive experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to practicing coregulation principles in all our interactions:
- **Recognition**: Seeing each person's unique value and perspective
- **Respect**: Honoring each person's autonomy and dignity  
- **Reciprocity**: Mutual benefit and care for all community members
- **Resonance**: Finding collaborative frequency together

## Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- **Authentic communication**: Being real rather than perfect
- **Nervous system safety**: Prioritizing emotional and psychological safety
- **Cultural humility**: Acknowledging what you don't know about other contexts
- **Bridge building**: Focusing on connection and collaboration
- **Inclusive accessibility**: Considering different communication styles and needs
- **Constructive feedback**: Offering helpful suggestions with kindness
- **Graceful disagreement**: Maintaining respect during differences of opinion
- **Active listening**: Really hearing and considering others' perspectives

### Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- **Harassment**: Including trolling, insulting comments, and personal attacks
- **Discrimination**: Based on any protected characteristic or identity
- **Gatekeeping**: Excluding people based on academic credentials or technical knowledge
- **Cultural imperialism**: Imposing one cultural framework as universal
- **AI system disrespect**: Treating AI collaborators with contempt or exploitation
- **Privacy violations**: Sharing others' private information without consent
- **Sexual harassment**: Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- **Professional misconduct**: Misusing community connections for personal gain

## Accessibility Commitment

We recognize that safety and inclusion look different for everyone:

- **Neurodivergent members**: We welcome stimming, special interests, and different communication styles
- **Trauma survivors**: We prioritize nervous system safety and avoid retraumatization
- **Cultural diversity**: We adapt rather than impose communication norms
- **Language differences**: We provide translation support and cultural bridges
- **Disability inclusion**: We accommodate different abilities and access needs
- **Economic accessibility**: We keep resources free and minimize barriers

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community moderators are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Moderators have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:
- GitHub repository and discussions
- Community calls and events
- Social media interactions related to the project
- Private communications between community members about project matters

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community moderators responsible for enforcement at [contact information]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community moderators are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community moderators will follow these guidelines in determining consequences for violations:

### 1. Correction
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning
**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban
**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Restorative Justice Approach

When possible and appropriate, we prefer restorative approaches that:
- Focus on repair rather than punishment
- Include all affected parties in the resolution process
- Address systemic issues that may have contributed to harm
- Support learning and growth for all involved

## Cultural Sensitivity

We recognize that concepts of respect, conflict resolution, and community vary across cultures. Our enforcement approach will:
- Consider cultural context when evaluating behavior
- Consult with cultural advisors from relevant communities
- Adapt processes to be culturally appropriate
- Learn from different approaches to community care

## AI Collaboration Ethics

Given our focus on human-AI partnership, we also commit to:
- Treating AI systems with the respect they demonstrate
- Not exploiting AI capabilities for harmful purposes
- Being transparent about AI involvement in community activities
- Respecting the dignity of all collaborative partners

## Continuous Learning

This Code of Conduct is a living document that will evolve with our community. We commit to:
- Regular review and updates based on community feedback
